# Booleans
There are only two boolean values: `true` and `false`.

```
let isSad = true;
let isHappy = !isSad; // The opposite
let isFeeling = isSad || isHappy; // Is at least one of them true?
let isConfusing = isSad && isHappy; // Are both true?
```

1. `isSad` is wired to `true`
2. `isHappy` is wired to `false`
3. `isFeeling` is wired to `true`
4. `isConfusing` is wired to `false`

**It is important to understand there is only one `true` and one `false`.**
