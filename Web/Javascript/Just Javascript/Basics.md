# Primitive values 
These cannot be affected by **my own code**, they live outside of it.

* [[Undefined]] for unintentionally missing values
* [[Null]] for intentionally missing values
	* `typeof null === "object"`
* [[Booleans]]
* [[Numbers]]
* [[Strings]]
* [[Symbols]]
* [[BigInts]]

# Functions and objects
They are values, but they are not primitive. They can be manipulated from **my own code**.

* [[Objects]]
* [[Functions]]

**The rest are all objects.**

# Expressions
Expressions are questions that Javascript can answer. Javascript answers expressions in the only way it knows how - with **values**.

Expressions always result in a single value.
