Green Deal was announced by European Commission in December 2019.

Green Deal will transform the EU into a modern economy, ensuring:
- no net emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050
- economic growth decoupled from resource use
- no person and no place left behind

**One third of the 1.8 trillion euro** investments from the NextGenerationEU Recovery Plan, and the EU's seven-year budget will finance the European Green Deal.
