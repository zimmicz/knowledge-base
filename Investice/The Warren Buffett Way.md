# The Warren Buffett Way
Buy certainties at a discount
___

An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and a satisfactory return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.
___
A true investment must have two qualities - some degree of safety of principal and a satisfactory rate of return.
___

Graham reduced the concept of sound investing to a motto he called the "margin of safety". With this motto, he sought to unite all securities, stocks, and bonds in a singular approach to investing. In essence, a margin of safety exists when securities are selling - for whatever reason - at less than their real value. The notion of buying undervalued securities regardless of market levels was a novel idea in the 1930s and 1940s. Graham's goal was to outline such a strategy.

Graham acknowledged that the single most important factor in determining a company's value was its future earnings power, a calculation that is bound to be imprecise. Simply stated, a company's intrinsic value could be found by estimating the earnings of the company and multiplying the earnings by an appropriate capitalization factor. The company's stability of earnings, assets, dividend policy, and financial health influenced this capitalization factor, or multiplier.
___

Buying a stock for a price that is less than two-thrids of its net assets fit neatly into Graham's sense of the present and satisfied his desire for some mathematical expectation. Graham gave no weight to a company's plant, property, and equipment. Furthermore, he deducted all the company's short- and long-term liabilities. What remained would be the net current assets. If the stock price was below this per share value, Graham reasoned that a margin of safety existed and purchase was warranted.
___

The value of any investment is the discounted present value of its future cash flow.
___

Williams's theory, known today as the **dividend discount model**, or discounted net cashflow analysis, provides a way to put a value on a stock or a bond. Like many important ideas, it can be reduced to a very simple precept: To know what a security is worth today, estimate all the cash it will earn over its lifetime and then discount that total back to a present value. It is the underlying methodology that Warren Buffett uses to evaluate stocks and companies.

Williams's model is a two-step process. First it measures cash flows to determine a company's current and future worth. How to estimate cash flows? One quick measure is dividends paid to shareholders. For companies that do not distribute dividends, Williams believed that in theory all retained earnings should eventually turn into dividends. Once a company reaches its mature stage, it would not need to reinvest its earnings for growth so the management could start distributing the earnings in the form of dividends. Williams wrote "*If earnings not paid out in dividends are all succesfully reinvested, then these earnings should produce dividends later; if not, then they are money lost. In short, a stock is worth only what you can get out of it.*"

The second step is to discount those estimated cash flows, to allow for some uncertainty. We can never be exactly sure what a company will do, how its products will sell, or what management will do or not do to improve the business. There is always an element of risk, particularly for stocks, event though Williams's theory applies equally well to bonds.

What, then, should we use as a discount rate? Williams himself is not explicit on this point, apparently believing his readers could determine themselves what would be appropriate. Buffett's measuring stick is very straightforward. He uses either interest rate for longterm (ten-year) U.S. bonds, or when interest rates are very low, he uses average cumulative rate of return of the overall stock market.

It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.
___

He has three touchstones: It must be the type of company that he understands, possessing good economics, and run by trustworthy managers. That's also what he looks for in stocks - and for the same reasons.
___

The best business to own, says Buffett, is one that over time can employ large amounts of capital at very high rates of return.
___

The most distinguishing trait of Buffett's investment philosophy is the clear understanding that by owning shares of stocks he owns businesses, not pieces of paper.

## Business tenets
1. Is the business simple and understandable?
2. Does the business have a consistent operating history?
3. Does the business have favorable long-term prospects?

## Management tenets
1. Is management rational?
2. Is management candid with its shareholders?
3. Does management resist the institutional imperative? _e.g. does it make decisions regardless of what others are doing_

When considering a new investment or a business acquisition, Buffett looks very hard at the quality of management. He tells us that the companies or stocks Berkshire purchases must be operated by honest and competent managers whom he can admire and trust.

The most important management act is allocation of the company's capital.

`GAAP = Generally accepted Accounting Principles`

Financial accounting standards only require disclosure of business information classified by industry segment. Some managers exploit this minimum requirement and lump together all the company's businesses into one industry segment, making it difficult for owners to understand the dynamics of their separate business interests.

Even when stock options are treated as a legitimate aspect of executive compensation, Buffett cautions us to watch how they are accounted for on a company's balance sheet. He believes they should be considered an expense so that their effect on reported earnings is clear. This seems so obvious as to be unarguable; sadly, not all companies see it this way.

## Financial tenets
1. What is the return on equity
2. What are the company's "owner earnings"?
3. What are the profit margins?
4. Has the company created at least one dollar of market value for every dollar retained?

For one thing, he does not take yearly results too seriously. Instead, he focuses on four- or five-year averages. Often, he notes, profitable business returns might not coincide with the time it takes for the planet to circle the sun.

- Focus on return on equity, not earnings per share.
- Calculate "owner earnings" to get a true reflection of value
- Look for companies with high profit margins
- For every dollar retained, has the company created at least a dollar of market value?

Coca-Cola earnings. 10 percent growth between 1988-1998. In 1999, growth rate slows to 5 percent a year. Using a discount rate of 9 percent (the long-term U.S. bond rate at the time).

| Year | Owner earnings |
|---|---|
|1988| $828 million|
|1989| $828 million * 1.15|
|1990| $952 million * 1.15|
|1991| $1095 million * 1.15|
|1992| $1259 million * 1.15|
|1993| $1448 million * 1.15|
|1994| $1665 million * 1.15|
|1995| $2202 million * 1.15|
|1996| $2532 million * 1.15|
|1997| $2912 million * 1.15|
|1998| $3349 million|
| 1999 | $3349 million * 1.05 = $3516 million|

Now, we can subtract the 5 percent growth in 1999 from the risk-free rate of return (9 percent) and reach a capitalization rate of 4 percent. The discounted value of a company with $3.516 billion in owner earnings capitalized at 4 percent is $87.9 billion (3.516 * 100 / 4).

Since this value, $87.9 billion, is the discounted value of Coca-Cola’s owner earnings in year eleven, we next have to discount this future value by the discount factor at the end of year ten `(1/(1+0.09))^10 = .4224`.

The f irst stage applies 15 percent annual growth for ten years, starting in  
1988. In year one, 1988, owner earnings were $828 million; by year ten,  
they will be $4.349 billion. Starting with year eleven, growth will slow to 5  
percent per year, the second stage. In year eleven, owner earnings will equal  
$3.516 billion ($3.349 billion × 5 percent + $3.349 billion). Now, we can  
subtract this 5 percent growth rate from the risk-free rate of return (9 per-  
cent) and reach a capitalization rate of 4 percent. The discounted value of a  
company with $3.516 billion in owner earnings capitalized at 4 percent is  
$87.9 billion. Since this value, $87.9 billion, is the discounted value of Coca-  
Cola’s owner earnings in year eleven, we next have to discount this future  
value by the discount factor at the end of year ten [1/(1+.09)10] = .4224. The  
present value of the residual value of Coca-Cola in year ten is $37.129 bil-  
lion. The value of Coca-Cola then equals its residual value ($37.129 billion)  
plus the sum of the present value of cash f lows during this period ($11.248  
billion), for a total of $48.377 billion.

## Value tenets
1. What is the value of the company?
2. Can it be purchased at a significant discount to its value?

**Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.**

___

In Buffett's view, investors' financial success is correlated to the degree in which they understand their investment. This understanding is a distinguishing trait that separates investors with a business orientation from most hit-and-run investors, people who merely buy shares of stock.
___

Buffett also tends to avoid businesses that are solving difficult problems.
